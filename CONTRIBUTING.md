# How To Contribute

If you wish to contribute to the project, you will need to install the development dependencies for this project, using `npm install`

All of the CSS styles are generated using Gulp-Sass, and the SASS source can be found in the `src/sass` directory. __DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THE DIST FOLDER. THEY WILL BE OVERWRITTEN__

All javascript is compiled for the browser using babel. Please follow the coding style demonstrated in src/js when contributing javascript code.

To build the dist folder, simply run `gulp`. You must have `gulp-cli` installed globally on your system for this to work. Try `npm i -g gulp-cli`
